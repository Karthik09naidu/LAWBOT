"""What is the Constitution of India?""","""The Constitution of India is the supreme legal document that establishes the framework of the country’s governance, adopted on November 26, 1949, and effective from January 26, 1950. It is the longest written constitution globally, with 448 articles, 12 schedules, and 5 appendices as of 2025, reflecting India’s federal structure, parliamentary democracy, and secular ethos. Drafted by the Constituent Assembly led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, it draws from sources like the Government of India Act, 1935, and constitutions of the USA, UK, and Ireland. It guarantees Fundamental Rights (Articles 12-35), Directive Principles of State Policy (Articles 36-51), and Fundamental Duties (Article 51A), while outlining the separation of powers among the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary. Amendments (over 100 by 2025) allow adaptability, as seen in the 42nd Amendment (1976) during the Emergency, balancing rigidity and flexibility for a diverse nation."""
"""What is Section 498A IPC?""","""Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, addresses cruelty by a husband or his relatives toward a married woman. It penalizes subjecting a woman to cruelty—defined as willful conduct likely to drive her to suicide, cause grave injury, or harass her for dowry—with imprisonment up to three years and a fine. Introduced in 1983 to combat dowry-related harassment, it’s cognizable and non-bailable, allowing police to act swiftly. The Supreme Court in Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India (2005) noted its misuse in false cases, leading to guidelines in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. (2017) to filter genuine complaints via Family Welfare Committees. Despite its protective intent, debates persist on its gender-specific nature and potential for abuse, balancing victim protection with fair trial rights."""
"""What is a writ petition?""","""A writ petition is a formal request filed in a High Court or the Supreme Court of India under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution, respectively, seeking enforcement of Fundamental Rights or other legal rights. Writs include habeas corpus (to release unlawful detention), mandamus (to compel public duty), certiorari (to quash judicial errors), prohibition (to stop lower courts), and quo warranto (to challenge public office holders). It’s a swift remedy against state actions, requiring the petitioner to show a legal right and violation. Landmark cases like A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950) and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) shaped its scope. The process involves drafting, filing with court fees, and awaiting a hearing, with PILs expanding access to marginalized groups."""
"""What is the role of the Supreme Court?""","""The Supreme Court of India, established under Article 124 of the Constitution, is the highest judicial body, serving as the guardian of the Constitution and the final court of appeal. Located in New Delhi, it comprises the Chief Justice and up to 34 judges (as of 2024), appointed by the President. Its roles include interpreting the Constitution (e.g., Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, 1973, on basic structure), settling inter-state disputes, and reviewing lower court decisions. It has original jurisdiction in federal matters (Article 131) and advisory jurisdiction (Article 143). Through public interest litigation and suo motu cases, it addresses social issues, like environmental protection in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India (1997), ensuring justice and constitutional supremacy."""
"""What is the difference between bailable and non-bailable offenses?""","""In India, bailable and non-bailable offenses are categorized under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC). Bailable offenses, listed in the First Schedule, include less severe crimes like minor theft (Section 379 IPC) or public nuisance, where the accused has a right to bail under Section 436, granted by police or courts with minimal scrutiny, often on a personal bond. Non-bailable offenses, such as murder (Section 302 IPC) or rape (Section 376 IPC), involve serious crimes where bail is discretionary under Section 437, requiring judicial approval based on factors like evidence strength, flight risk, or public safety. The distinction affects arrest and detention, with non-bailable cases allowing pre-trial custody, as clarified in State of Rajasthan v. Balchand (1977)."""
"""What is the Consumer Protection Act?""","""The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, in India, replaced the 1986 Act to safeguard consumer rights against defective goods, services, and unfair trade practices. Enacted on July 20, 2020, it establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to promote, protect, and enforce consumer rights, with powers to issue safety notices and penalties. It provides a three-tier redressal system—District, State, and National Commissions—handling complaints via mediation or adjudication, with compensation up to Rs. 10 crore at the National level. Key rights include the right to safety, information, choice, and redressal, as seen in cases like Karnataka Power Transmission Corp. Ltd. v. Ashok Iron Works Pvt. Ltd. (2009). E-commerce falls under its ambit, addressing online fraud, reflecting modern consumer needs."""
"""What is the Motor Vehicles Act?""","""The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, is the primary legislation in India governing vehicular traffic, licensing, registration, and road safety. Amended in 2019, it aims to enhance road discipline and compensate accident victims, with provisions for third-party insurance and penalties for violations like drunk driving (Section 185) or overloading. It mandates licenses (Chapter II), vehicle registration (Chapter III), and permits (Chapter V), enforced by transport authorities. The 2019 amendment increased fines (e.g., Rs. 10,000 for rash driving) and introduced motor vehicle accident funds for hit-and-run cases. The Supreme Court in Jai Prakash v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. (2019) emphasized its victim-centric approach, balancing regulation with compensation, crucial for India’s growing traffic challenges."""
"""What is the Dowry Prohibition Act?""","""The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, aims to prevent the demand, giving, or taking of dowry in India, a social evil linked to harassment and bride burning. It declares dowry transactions illegal under Section 3, punishable with imprisonment up to five years and a fine up to Rs. 15,000 or the dowry value. Section 4 penalizes dowry demands, while Section 7 mandates reporting within seven years. Amended in 1986, it aligns with IPC Section 498A for cruelty cases. Enforcement is weak due to societal norms, but cases like Ashok Kumar v. State of Rajasthan (1990) underscore its intent. The Act established Dowry Prohibition Officers to monitor compliance, though challenges like underreporting persist."""
"""What is the Hindu Marriage Act?""","""The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, governs marriage, divorce, and related matters for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs in India. It recognizes marriage as a sacrament, requiring conditions like mental capacity and no subsisting marriage (Section 5). It provides for judicial separation (Section 10), divorce (Section 13) on grounds like cruelty or desertion, and restitution of conjugal rights (Section 9). The Act allows monogamy, a shift from traditional polygamy, and minimum marriageable ages (21 for men, 18 for women). Landmark cases like Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995) upheld its secular intent against bigamy. It balances personal law with gender equality, though customary practices sometimes challenge its enforcement."""
"""What is the difference between a will and a codicil?""","""In Indian law, a will is a legal document under the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (Sections 57-191), executed by a person (testator) to distribute property after death, requiring sound mind and two witnesses. A codicil is an amendment or addition to an existing will, made to modify or revoke specific provisions without rewriting the entire document, governed by the same legal formalities (Section 162). For example, a will bequeathing a house can be updated via a codicil to change the beneficiary. Both must be signed and attested, with the codicil treated as part of the will. Cases like Gnanamuthu v. Vana Koilpillai (1969) clarify their validity, ensuring testamentary intent is preserved."""
"""What is the Right to Education Act?""","""The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 in India, under Article 21A of the Constitution. Enacted on August 26, 2009, it requires schools to provide infrastructure, trained teachers, and no-capitation fees, with a 25% reservation for disadvantaged groups. It aims to reduce dropout rates and ensure quality education, as upheld in Society for Unaided Private Schools v. Union of India (2012). State governments fund it, with the Central government sharing costs. Challenges include inadequate implementation and teacher shortages, but it’s a milestone in educational equity, aligning with global standards."""
"""What is the difference between lease and license?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a lease and a license differ in their legal nature. A lease (Sections 105-117) is a transfer of an interest in immovable property for a term, granting exclusive possession to the lessee (e.g., renting a house), with rent and duration specified, creating a landlord-tenant relationship. A license (Section 52) is a permission to use property without transferring interest, revocable at the licensor’s will (e.g., event venue access), offering no possession rights. The Supreme Court in Associated Hotels of India v. R.N. Kapoor (1960) distinguished them: a lease confers a right in rem (against the world), while a license is a personal right in personam. Misclassification impacts eviction rights."""
"""What is the Prevention of Corruption Act?""","""The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, combats corruption among public servants in India, amended in 2018 to align with UN conventions. It defines offenses like bribery (Section 7), criminal misconduct (Section 13), and abetment (Section 12), with punishments including imprisonment up to 7 years or life, and fines. It covers government employees, judges, and public servants, with the CBI and Anti-Corruption Bureaus enforcing it. The 2018 amendment introduced prior sanction exemptions for cases by citizens and corporate liability for bribe-giving. Cases like Vineet Narain v. Union of India (1998) strengthened its enforcement, but challenges include political interference and low conviction rates, making it a critical anti-graft tool."""
"""What is the Juvenile Justice Act?""","""The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, governs children in conflict with law (below 18) and those in need of care in India. Replacing the 2000 Act, it balances rehabilitation with justice, allowing 16-18-year-olds in heinous offenses (e.g., murder) to be tried as adults under certain conditions (Section 15), post the Nirbhaya case influence. It establishes Juvenile Justice Boards for adjudication and Child Welfare Committees for protection, focusing on restoration via counseling or foster care. The Act aligns with UN child rights conventions, with cases like Salil Bali v. Union of India (2013) debating its maturity test, aiming to protect while addressing public safety."""
"""What is the difference between movable and immovable property?""","""In Indian law, under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, movable and immovable property differ in nature and transfer. Immovable property (Section 3) includes land, buildings, and benefits arising from land (e.g., rent), requiring registered deeds for transfer (e.g., sale deed). Movable property encompasses goods, money, or chattels (e.g., cars, jewelry), transferable via delivery or endorsement, governed by the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The distinction affects taxation, succession, and legal remedies—immovable property suits fall under civil courts, while movable disputes may involve criminal law (e.g., theft). Cases like Anand Behera v. State of Orissa (1956) clarify this for inheritance, impacting legal proceedings."""
"""What is the Arbitration and Conciliation Act?""","""The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, governs alternative dispute resolution in India, based on the UNCITRAL Model Law. It promotes arbitration, conciliation, and mediation for commercial disputes, reducing court burden. Part I covers domestic arbitration (Section 2-43), allowing parties to choose arbitrators and procedures, with awards enforceable as decrees. Part II deals with international arbitration (Section 44-60). The 2015 and 2019 amendments expedited processes, limiting court interference (e.g., Bharat Aluminium Co. v. Kaiser Aluminium, 2012). It’s cost-effective and confidential, but challenges include arbitrator bias, addressed by the 2019 Act’s independence criteria, making it vital for trade disputes."""
"""What is the difference between a decree and an order?""","""Under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), a decree and an order differ in scope and finality. A decree (Section 2(2)) is the formal expression of an adjudication conclusively determining the rights of parties in a suit, issued by a court, covering final, preliminary, or partly preliminary decisions (e.g., divorce decree). An order (Section 2(14)) is a direction of a court not amounting to a decree, addressing procedural or interim matters (e.g., injunctions, payment directions). Decrees are appealable under Section 96, while most orders are not unless specified (e.g., Section 104). Cases like Madan Naik v. Hansubala Devi (1983) highlight their distinction, impacting legal remedies."""
"""What is the Evidence Act?""","""The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, regulates the admissibility, relevance, and presentation of evidence in Indian courts. It applies to civil and criminal proceedings, defining facts (Section 3), oral and documentary evidence (Sections 59-60), and presumptions (e.g., Section 114). Key provisions include the exclusion of hearsay (Section 60), privilege (e.g., lawyer-client, Section 126), and expert testimony (Section 45). Amendments, like the 2002 change allowing video evidence, modernized it. Landmark cases like R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra (1973) upheld taped conversations’ admissibility if authentic. It ensures fair trials, balancing proof with justice, though digital evidence challenges persist."""
"""What is the difference between a plaint and a written statement?""","""In the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, a plaint and a written statement are pivotal civil suit documents. A plaint (Order VII) is the plaintiff’s initial filing, detailing the cause of action, relief sought (e.g., damages), and parties involved, initiating the suit. A written statement (Order VIII) is the defendant’s response, admitting or denying allegations, raising defenses, and counterclaims if any. The plaint requires a court fee, while the written statement has a 30-day filing limit (extendable). Cases like Umesh Chandra v. Vraj Kishore (1955) stress their mutual dependency—plaint sets the claim, written statement shapes the defense, driving the trial’s course."""
"""What is the Limitation Act?""","""The Limitation Act, 1963, prescribes time limits for filing suits, appeals, or applications in Indian courts to ensure timely justice. It lists periods (e.g., 3 years for contract breaches under Article 55, 12 years for property recovery under Article 65) in its Schedule, starting from the cause of action’s accrual. Section 5 allows condonation of delay with sufficient cause, as seen in Collector, Land Acquisition v. Mst. Katiji (1987). The Act bars remedies after expiry, not rights, promoting legal diligence. Exceptions include fraud (Section 17) or disability (Section 6). It balances justice with finality, impacting civil and criminal proceedings."""
"""What is the difference between a suit and a petition?""","""Under Indian law, a suit and a petition differ in purpose and procedure. A suit, governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is a formal legal action between private parties (e.g., property disputes) seeking remedies like damages or possession, filed in civil courts with a plaint. A petition is a request to a higher court (e.g., Supreme Court under Article 32, High Court under Article 226) for extraordinary relief, like writs (habeas corpus) or constitutional issues, often public-interest driven. Suits follow adversarial trials, while petitions may involve summary proceedings. Cases like A.K. Gopalan (1950) distinguish their jurisdictional scope, shaping legal strategy."""
"""What is the role of a Public Prosecutor?""","""A Public Prosecutor in India, appointed under Section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, represents the state in criminal cases, ensuring justice over mere conviction. They review police reports, file chargesheets, and present evidence in court, acting independently of police. Appointed by the government for Central or State levels, they handle serious offenses (e.g., murder, corruption). The Supreme Court in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh v. State of Gujarat (2004) emphasized their duty to protect witnesses and public interest, not just secure convictions. Their role balances prosecution with fairness, crucial in adversarial systems, though political influence sometimes challenges impartiality."""
"""What is the difference between a gift and a sale?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift and a sale differ in consideration and intent. A gift (Section 122) is a voluntary transfer of immovable or movable property without monetary consideration, made out of love or affection, requiring a registered deed for immovable property and acceptance by the donee. A sale (Section 54) is a transfer for a price paid or promised, governed by a contract, with registration mandatory for immovable property above Rs. 100. Gifts are irrevocable once accepted, while sales are contractual, cancellable for breach. Cases like K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vora (2009) clarify their distinct legal effects on title transfer."""
"""What is the Negotiable Instruments Act?""","""The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, regulates promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques in India, facilitating commercial transactions. It defines these instruments (Sections 4-6), their negotiation (Section 14), and liabilities (e.g., Section 31 on bankers). Section 138 penalizes cheque dishonor due to insufficient funds with up to two years’ imprisonment and double the cheque amount as compensation, amended in 2018 to expedite trials. Cases like Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharashtra (2014) refined jurisdiction rules. It ensures trust in financial instruments, though digital payment shifts challenge its relevance, prompting judicial adaptations."""
"""What is the difference between a tenant and a licensee?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a tenant and a licensee differ in rights. A tenant, under a lease (Section 105), holds exclusive possession of immovable property for a term, paying rent, with rights to use and sublet (unless restricted), creating a landlord-tenant relationship. A licensee, under a license (Section 52), has mere permission to use property without possession rights, revocable by the licensor (e.g., event access). The Supreme Court in Associated Hotels of India v. R.N. Kapoor (1960) ruled that possession distinguishes them—tenants have legal interest, licensees don’t. This impacts eviction and rent laws."""
"""What is the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act?""","""The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, addresses domestic violence against women in India, including physical, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse by husbands or live-in partners. It provides civil remedies like protection orders (Section 18), residence rights (Section 19), and monetary relief (Section 20), enforceable through magistrates. It covers all women, not just married ones, and establishes Protection Officers. The Act, post the 2005 amendment, was upheld in cases like Sandhya Manoj Wankhade v. Manoj Bhimrao Wankhade (2011) for live-in relationships. Challenges include underreporting and slow enforcement, but it’s a pivotal gender justice tool."""
"""What is the difference between a criminal case and a civil case?""","""In India, a criminal case and a civil case differ in nature and process. A criminal case, prosecuted by the state under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and CrPC, 1973, addresses offenses against society (e.g., murder), aiming for punishment (imprisonment, fines), with the state bearing the burden of proof “beyond reasonable doubt.” A civil case, governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, involves private disputes (e.g., property, divorce), seeking remedies like compensation, with the plaintiff proving on a “preponderance of probabilities” standard. Overlap exists (e.g., dowry deaths), but criminal cases protect public order, while civil cases restore individual rights, as seen in cases like State v. Ram Lal (1960)."""
"""What is the role of the High Court?""","""The High Court in India, established under Article 214 of the Constitution, is the highest judicial authority at the state level, with a Chief Justice and other judges (e.g., 47 in Delhi High Court as of 2024). It has original jurisdiction in constitutional, civil, and criminal matters, appellate jurisdiction over lower courts, and supervisory power under Article 227. It issues writs (Article 226) for Fundamental Rights enforcement, as in D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997) on police custody rights. Each state or union territory has a High Court, with some shared (e.g., Punjab and Haryana), playing a pivotal role in justice delivery and legal interpretation."""
"""What is the difference between a void and voidable contract?""","""Under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a void contract (Section 2(g)) is invalid from the outset, lacking legal enforceability due to illegality (e.g., wagering) or impossibility, with no rights or obligations arising, as in Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903). A voidable contract (Section 2(i)) is valid until rescinded by the aggrieved party, affected by factors like coercion or fraud (e.g., Section 19), allowing the victim to affirm or reject it. Void contracts are null, while voidable ones offer a choice, impacting remedies—void contracts yield no compensation, while voidable ones may. Cases like Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur (1954) clarify their distinction."""
"""What is the Specific Relief Act?""","""The Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides remedies in India for enforcing civil rights when damages are inadequate. It allows specific performance of contracts (e.g., property sales, Section 10), injunctions (Section 36-42) to prevent harm, and recovery of possession (Section 5-8). Governed by equity principles, it applies when monetary compensation isn’t sufficient, as in K.S. Vidyanadam v. Vairavan (1997). Amendments in 2018 expedited proceedings, barring suits against government contracts (Section 20A). It balances contractual obligations with judicial discretion, crucial for property and trust disputes, though delays in execution remain a challenge."""
"""What is the difference between a power of attorney and a will?""","""In Indian law, a power of attorney (POA) and a will differ in purpose and effect. A POA, under the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882, is a legal authorization allowing one person (agent) to act for another (principal) during the principal’s lifetime, revocable, covering acts like property sales. A will, under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, is a testamentary document disposing of property after the testator’s death, taking effect posthumously, requiring two witnesses. A POA is operative immediately or as specified, while a will is dormant until death. Cases like Manak Chand v. Ram Chandra (1980) distinguish their scope, impacting agency and succession."""
"""What is the role of the Election Commission?""","""The Election Commission of India (ECI), established under Article 324 of the Constitution, is an autonomous body overseeing elections to Parliament, state legislatures, and the President/Vice-President. Comprising a Chief Election Commissioner and two Commissioners (as of 2025), it ensures free and fair elections, registering parties, monitoring campaign finances, and enforcing the Model Code of Conduct. It delineates constituencies and updates electoral rolls, as seen in its 2024 delimitation efforts. Cases like T.N. Seshan v. Union of India (1995) affirmed its independence. Its powers, though vast, face challenges from political pressures, making it a democratic cornerstone."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu Undivided Family and a joint family?""","""In Indian law, a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) and a joint family are related but distinct. An HUF, recognized under the Income Tax Act, 1961, is a legal entity of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, or Buddhists sharing a common ancestor, coparceners (males and, post-2005 amendment, females) holding ancestral property with coparcenary rights, taxed separately. A joint family is a broader social unit, including all members (coparceners and non-coparceners) living together with shared customs, not necessarily a legal entity. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, in cases like Prakash v. Phulavati (2016), equalized daughters’ rights, aligning HUF with joint family evolution."""
"""What is the Information Technology Act?""","""The Information Technology Act, 2000, amended in 2008, governs electronic transactions, cybercrime, and data protection in India. It recognizes digital signatures (Section 3), facilitates e-governance, and penalizes offenses like hacking (Section 66), data theft, and online fraud (Section 66A, struck down in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, 2015). It establishes the Cyber Appellate Tribunal (now defunct, merged with TDSAT) and empowers the government to block content. The 2008 amendment added Section 69 for surveillance and Section 79 for intermediary liability. It aligns with global cyber norms, though enforcement lags due to technical and jurisdictional issues."""
"""What is the difference between a mortgage and a pledge?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a mortgage and a pledge differ in asset type and rights. A mortgage (Section 58) involves transferring an interest in immovable property (e.g., land) as security for a loan, with the mortgagor retaining possession unless agreed otherwise, redeemable under Section 60. A pledge (Section 172, Indian Contract Act, 1872) is a bailment of movable property (e.g., gold) to a creditor, who gains possession but not ownership, with the pawner redeeming it. Mortgages require registration, pledges don’t. Cases like K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi Rao (1964) distinguish their enforceability, impacting recovery processes."""
"""What is the role of the National Human Rights Commission?""","""The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is an autonomous body in India to protect and promote human rights. Headed by a retired Chief Justice of India and members with judicial or human rights expertise, it investigates violations (e.g., custodial deaths, discrimination) under Article 21, recommends remedies, and advises the government. It lacks enforcement power, relying on moral suasion, as seen in its 2023 report on manual scavenging. Cases like NHRC v. State of Arunachal Pradesh (1996) highlight its role in tribal rights. Its effectiveness is limited by resource constraints and state compliance issues."""
"""What is the difference between a trust and a society?""","""In India, a trust and a society differ in legal structure and purpose. A trust, under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, is a relationship where property is held by a trustee for beneficiaries, created for private (e.g., family) or public (e.g., charity) purposes, requiring a trust deed. A society, under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, is an association of persons (minimum seven) for promoting art, science, or charity, registered with a memorandum of association, functioning democratically. Trusts are managed by trustees, societies by governing bodies. Cases like CIT v. Trustees of H.E.H. The Nizam’s Wedding Gifts Trusts (1986) clarify their tax implications, impacting nonprofit operations."""
"""What is the Benami Transactions Act?""","""The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, amended in 2016 as the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, prevents benami transactions—property held by one person for another’s benefit to evade taxes or law. It declares such transactions void (Section 3), with penalties including confiscation (Section 5) and up to seven years’ imprisonment (Section 53). The 2016 amendment strengthened enforcement via the Benami Prohibition Authority. Cases like Ganpati Dealcom Pvt. Ltd. v. UOI (2017) upheld its retrospective application, targeting black money. Challenges include defining benami intent and procedural delays, making it a key anti-corruption tool."""
"""What is the difference between a summons and a warrant?""","""Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, a summons and a warrant differ in purpose and issuance. A summons (Section 61) is a court order requiring a person’s appearance to answer a non-serious offense or as a witness, served by police or post, non-custodial. A warrant (Section 70) is a judicial authorization for arrest, issued for serious offenses or non-compliance, executable by police with custody. Summons are bailable, warrants may be bailable or non-bailable. The Supreme Court in Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal (2007) stressed warrants’ necessity, ensuring due process while balancing enforcement needs."""
"""What is the role of the Central Vigilance Commission?""","""The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), established in 1964 and statutorily under the CVC Act, 2003, is an anti-corruption watchdog in India, overseeing central government employees and public sector undertakings. Headed by a Central Vigilance Commissioner, it advises on corruption prevention, investigates complaints, and supervises the CBI in anti-corruption cases (excluding sanction). It promotes transparency via vigilance awareness weeks. Cases like Vineet Narain v. Union of India (1998) enhanced its autonomy. Its advisory role limits enforcement, relying on government action, facing challenges from political interference and resource constraints."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu and Muslim personal law?""","""In India, Hindu and Muslim personal laws differ due to religious foundations. Hindu law, under acts like the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and Hindu Succession Act, 1956, governs marriage, succession, and adoption for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists, codifying customs with state intervention (e.g., monogamy, equal inheritance). Muslim personal law, based on uncodified Sharia and the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, applies to Muslims, allowing polygamy (up to four wives), talaq (divorce), and inheritance favoring males (e.g., 2:1 ratio), with limited statutory reform (e.g., Shah Bano case, 1985). The Supreme Court in Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017) struck triple talaq, signaling reform, highlighting their divergent evolution."""
"""What is the Indian Succession Act?""","""The Indian Succession Act, 1925, consolidates succession and inheritance laws for Christians, Parsis, and others (excluding Muslims and Hindus, who follow personal laws). It governs testamentary succession (wills, Sections 57-191) and intestate succession (no will, Sections 32-56), ensuring equitable property distribution. For Christians, it mandates equal shares among heirs; for Parsis, it includes spousal rights. Wills require two witnesses and sound mind, with probate for immovable property. Cases like Anil Kak v. Kumari Shobha (2007) clarified its application. It harmonizes diverse practices, though gaps remain for uncodified communities."""
"""What is the difference between a plaint and a complaint?""","""Under Indian law, a plaint and a complaint differ in context. A plaint, under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Order VII), is a formal document initiating a civil suit, detailing the plaintiff’s claim (e.g., property dispute) and relief sought, filed in a civil court. A complaint, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Section 2(d)), is an allegation of a cognizable or non-cognizable offense made to a magistrate or police, prompting investigation or trial (e.g., theft). Plaints seek remedies, complaints trigger prosecution. Cases like Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre (1988) distinguish their procedural roles."""
"""What is the role of the Lokpal?""","""The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, established the Lokpal as an anti-corruption ombudsman in India, probing complaints against public servants, including the Prime Minister (with safeguards). Headed by a Chairperson and up to eight members, it has jurisdiction over central government officials, with state Lokayuktas mirroring it. It can order investigations, recommend action, and confiscate assets, as seen in its 2023 probe into MPs. The Supreme Court in Common Cause v. Union of India (2017) pushed its activation. Its effectiveness is hampered by delays in appointments and limited powers, aiming to enhance transparency."""
"""What is the difference between a leasehold and freehold property?""","""In India, under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, leasehold and freehold properties differ in ownership. Freehold property grants absolute ownership to the buyer, with perpetual rights to use, sell, or bequeath (e.g., outright land purchase), requiring no renewal. Leasehold property involves a lease agreement (Section 105) for a fixed term (e.g., 99 years), where the lessee holds rights subject to the lessor’s title, with rent and reversion to the owner post-term. Cases like T.V. Ibrahim v. Regional Transport Authority (1953) clarify leasehold’s temporary nature. This impacts taxation and transferability, with freehold offering more security."""

Challenges include social resistance and poor implementation, making it a key equality tool."""
"""What is the difference between a criminal appeal and a civil appeal?""","""In India, a criminal appeal and a civil appeal differ in basis and process. A criminal appeal, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (e.g., Section 374), challenges a conviction or acquittal in criminal cases (e.g., murder), filed by the accused or state in higher courts (High Court, Supreme Court), focusing on legal errors or evidence. A civil appeal, under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Section 96), contests civil judgments (e.g., property disputes), initiated by aggrieved parties, seeking remedy review. Criminal appeals prioritize justice, civil appeals focus on rights, as seen in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (1992)."""
"""What is the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General?""","""The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, under Article 148 of the Constitution, is the guardian of public finance, auditing central and state government accounts. Appointed by the President, the CAG ensures expenditure aligns with appropriations, submitting reports to Parliament/State Legislatures (e.g., 2G spectrum case, 2012). It has no executive role but influences policy via audit findings. Cases like Common Cause v. Union of India (1999) reinforced its independence. Challenges include delayed audits and limited follow-up, making it vital for fiscal accountability."""
"""What is the difference between a co-owner and a joint owner?""","""Under Indian law, a co-owner and a joint owner differ in property rights. A co-owner holds a distinct share in property (e.g., under a partition), with individual rights to sell or bequeath, governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. A joint owner, in a joint tenancy or Hindu Undivided Family, holds an undivided interest with others, with rights of survivorship (property passes to surviving owners), as in coparcenary property. The Hindu Succession Act, 2005, in Prakash v. Phulavati (2016), equalized daughters’ joint ownership. This impacts succession and division, with co-ownership allowing severance, joint ownership requiring unity."""

It penalizes acts like land grabbing (Section 3(1)(v)) or humiliation (Section 3(1)(x)) with imprisonment from six months to life. Amended in 2015, it added provisions for public servants’ complicity and enhanced penalties. Exclusive courts handle cases, with the Supreme Court in Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra (2018) refining arrest guidelines to curb misuse. Challenges include low conviction rates and social biases, making it a critical social justice law."""
"""What is the difference between a patent and a trademark?""","""In India, a patent and a trademark, under the Patents Act, 1970, and Trademarks Act, 1999, differ in protection. A patent grants exclusive rights for 20 years to an inventor for a new, non-obvious invention (e.g., a device), requiring a detailed application and examination by the Patent Office. A trademark protects a brand’s symbol, name, or logo (e.g., logos) indefinitely with renewal, registered to prevent confusion. Patents cover functional innovation, trademarks identity, as clarified in Bayer Corp. v. Union of India (2010), impacting commercial and legal strategies."""

Union of India (2013) reinforced its implementation, though awareness and reporting gaps persist."""
"""What is the difference between a negotiable instrument and a non-negotiable instrument?""","""Under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, a negotiable instrument (e.g., cheque, promissory note) is transferable by delivery or endorsement, conferring title to the holder (Section 13), used in commerce with legal recognition. A non-negotiable instrument (e.g., fixed deposit receipt) cannot be transferred, lacking negotiability, serving as a personal contract. The Supreme Court in Kundan Lal v. Custodian, Evacuee Property (1961) upheld this, impacting financial transactions’ fluidity versus security."""

It handles 20,000+ cases annually, as seen in its 2023 backlog reports. Cases like CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011) strengthened its role. Challenges include delays and limited enforcement power, making it key for accountability."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu joint family and a partnership?""","""In India, a Hindu joint family, under Hindu law, is a customary unit of coparceners (e.g., HUF) sharing ancestral property with survivorship rights, governed by birth, not contract. A partnership, under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, is a voluntary association of individuals (minimum two) for profit, based on a partnership deed, with mutual agency and liability. The Hindu Succession Act, 2005, altered joint family dynamics, while partnerships dissolve on death unless agreed, as in Cox v. Hickman (1860), impacting succession and business."""
"""What is the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act?""","""The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, ensures maintenance for parents and senior citizens (above 60) by children or relatives in India.

Drafted by the Constituent Assembly led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, it draws from sources like the Government of India Act, 1935, and constitutions of the USA, UK, and Ireland. It guarantees Fundamental Rights (Articles 12-35), Directive Principles of State Policy (Articles 36-51), and Fundamental Duties (Article 51A), while outlining the separation of powers among the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary. Amendments (over 100 by 2025) allow adaptability, as seen in the 42nd Amendment (1976) during the Emergency, balancing rigidity and flexibility for a diverse nation."""
"""What is Section 498A IPC?""","""Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, addresses cruelty by a husband or his relatives toward a married woman. It penalizes subjecting a woman to cruelty—defined as willful conduct likely to drive her to suicide, cause grave injury, or harass her for dowry—with imprisonment up to three years and a fine. Introduced in 1983 to combat dowry-related harassment, it’s cognizable and non-bailable, allowing police to act swiftly. The Supreme Court in Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India (2005) noted its misuse in false cases, leading to guidelines in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. (2017) to filter genuine complaints via Family Welfare Committees. Despite its protective intent, debates persist on its gender-specific nature and potential for abuse, balancing victim protection with fair trial rights."""
"""What is a writ petition?""","""A writ petition is a formal request filed in a High Court or the Supreme Court of India under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution, respectively, seeking enforcement of Fundamental Rights or other legal rights.

It’s a swift remedy against state actions, requiring the petitioner to show a legal right and violation. Landmark cases like A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950) and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) shaped its scope. The process involves drafting, filing with court fees, and awaiting a hearing, with PILs expanding access to marginalized groups."""

State of Kerala, 1973, on basic structure), settling inter-state disputes, and reviewing lower court decisions. It has original jurisdiction in federal matters (Article 131) and advisory jurisdiction (Article 143). Through public interest litigation and suo motu cases, it addresses social issues, like environmental protection in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India (1997), ensuring justice and constitutional supremacy."""
"""What is the difference between bailable and non-bailable offenses?""","""In India, bailable and non-bailable offenses are categorized under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC). Bailable offenses, listed in the First Schedule, include less severe crimes like minor theft (Section 379 IPC) or public nuisance, where the accused has a right to bail under Section 436, granted by police or courts with minimal scrutiny, often on a personal bond. Non-bailable offenses, such as murder (Section 302 IPC) or rape (Section 376 IPC), involve serious crimes where bail is discretionary under Section 437, requiring judicial approval based on factors like evidence strength, flight risk, or public safety. The distinction affects arrest and detention, with non-bailable cases allowing pre-trial custody, as clarified in State of Rajasthan v. Balchand (1977)."""
"""What is the Consumer Protection Act?""","""The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, in India, replaced the 1986 Act to safeguard consumer rights against defective goods, services, and unfair trade practices. Enacted on July 20, 2020, it establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to promote, protect, and enforce consumer rights, with powers to issue safety notices and penalties. It provides a three-tier redressal system—District, State, and National Commissions—handling complaints via mediation or adjudication, with compensation up to Rs. 10 crore at the National level. Key rights include the right to safety, information, choice, and redressal, as seen in cases like Karnataka Power Transmission Corp. Ltd. v. Ashok Iron Works Pvt. Ltd. (2009). E-commerce falls under its ambit, addressing online fraud, reflecting modern consumer needs."""
"""What is the Motor Vehicles Act?""","""The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, is the primary legislation in India governing vehicular traffic, licensing, registration, and road safety. Amended in 2019, it aims to enhance road discipline and compensate accident victims, with provisions for third-party insurance and penalties for violations like drunk driving (Section 185) or overloading. It mandates licenses (Chapter II), vehicle registration (Chapter III), and permits (Chapter V), enforced by transport authorities. The 2019 amendment increased fines (e.g., Rs. 10,000 for rash driving) and introduced motor vehicle accident funds for hit-and-run cases. The Supreme Court in Jai Prakash v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. (2019) emphasized its victim-centric approach, balancing regulation with compensation, crucial for India’s growing traffic challenges."""
"""What is the Dowry Prohibition Act?""","""The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, aims to prevent the demand, giving, or taking of dowry in India, a social evil linked to harassment and bride burning. It declares dowry transactions illegal under Section 3, punishable with imprisonment up to five years and a fine up to Rs. 15,000 or the dowry value. Section 4 penalizes dowry demands, while Section 7 mandates reporting within seven years. Amended in 1986, it aligns with IPC Section 498A for cruelty cases. Enforcement is weak due to societal norms, but cases like Ashok Kumar v. State of Rajasthan (1990) underscore its intent. The Act established Dowry Prohibition Officers to monitor compliance, though challenges like underreporting persist."""
"""What is the Hindu Marriage Act?""","""The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, governs marriage, divorce, and related matters for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs in India. It recognizes marriage as a sacrament, requiring conditions like mental capacity and no subsisting marriage (Section 5). It provides for judicial separation (Section 10), divorce (Section 13) on grounds like cruelty or desertion, and restitution of conjugal rights (Section 9). The Act allows monogamy, a shift from traditional polygamy, and minimum marriageable ages (21 for men, 18 for women). Landmark cases like Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995) upheld its secular intent against bigamy. It balances personal law with gender equality, though customary practices sometimes challenge its enforcement."""
"""What is the difference between a will and a codicil?""","""In Indian law, a will is a legal document under the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (Sections 57-191), executed by a person (testator) to distribute property after death, requiring sound mind and two witnesses. A codicil is an amendment or addition to an existing will, made to modify or revoke specific provisions without rewriting the entire document, governed by the same legal formalities (Section 162). For example, a will bequeathing a house can be updated via a codicil to change the beneficiary. Both must be signed and attested, with the codicil treated as part of the will. Cases like Gnanamuthu v. Vana Koilpillai (1969) clarify their validity, ensuring testamentary intent is preserved."""
"""What is the Right to Education Act?""","""The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 in India, under Article 21A of the Constitution. Enacted on August 26, 2009, it requires schools to provide infrastructure, trained teachers, and no-capitation fees, with a 25% reservation for disadvantaged groups. It aims to reduce dropout rates and ensure quality education, as upheld in Society for Unaided Private Schools v. Union of India (2012). State governments fund it, with the Central government sharing costs. Challenges include inadequate implementation and teacher shortages, but it’s a milestone in educational equity, aligning with global standards."""
"""What is the difference between lease and license?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a lease and a license differ in their legal nature. A lease (Sections 105-117) is a transfer of an interest in immovable property for a term, granting exclusive possession to the lessee (e.g., renting a house), with rent and duration specified, creating a landlord-tenant relationship. A license (Section 52) is a permission to use property without transferring interest, revocable at the licensor’s will (e.g., event venue access), offering no possession rights. The Supreme Court in Associated Hotels of India v. R.N. Kapoor (1960) distinguished them: a lease confers a right in rem (against the world), while a license is a personal right in personam. Misclassification impacts eviction rights."""
"""What is the Prevention of Corruption Act?""","""The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, combats corruption among public servants in India, amended in 2018 to align with UN conventions. It defines offenses like bribery (Section 7), criminal misconduct (Section 13), and abetment (Section 12), with punishments including imprisonment up to 7 years or life, and fines. It covers government employees, judges, and public servants, with the CBI and Anti-Corruption Bureaus enforcing it. The 2018 amendment introduced prior sanction exemptions for cases by citizens and corporate liability for bribe-giving. Cases like Vineet Narain v. Union of India (1998) strengthened its enforcement, but challenges include political interference and low conviction rates, making it a critical anti-graft tool."""
"""What is the Juvenile Justice Act?""","""The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, governs children in conflict with law (below 18) and those in need of care in India. Replacing the 2000 Act, it balances rehabilitation with justice, allowing 16-18-year-olds in heinous offenses (e.g., murder) to be tried as adults under certain conditions (Section 15), post the Nirbhaya case influence. It establishes Juvenile Justice Boards for adjudication and Child Welfare Committees for protection, focusing on restoration via counseling or foster care. The Act aligns with UN child rights conventions, with cases like Salil Bali v. Union of India (2013) debating its maturity test, aiming to protect while addressing public safety."""
"""What is the difference between movable and immovable property?""","""In Indian law, under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, movable and immovable property differ in nature and transfer. Immovable property (Section 3) includes land, buildings, and benefits arising from land (e.g., rent), requiring registered deeds for transfer (e.g., sale deed). Movable property encompasses goods, money, or chattels (e.g., cars, jewelry), transferable via delivery or endorsement, governed by the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The distinction affects taxation, succession, and legal remedies—immovable property suits fall under civil courts, while movable disputes may involve criminal law (e.g., theft). Cases like Anand Behera v. State of Orissa (1956) clarify this for inheritance, impacting legal proceedings."""
"""What is the Arbitration and Conciliation Act?""","""The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, governs alternative dispute resolution in India, based on the UNCITRAL Model Law. It promotes arbitration, conciliation, and mediation for commercial disputes, reducing court burden. Part I covers domestic arbitration (Section 2-43), allowing parties to choose arbitrators and procedures, with awards enforceable as decrees. Part II deals with international arbitration (Section 44-60). The 2015 and 2019 amendments expedited processes, limiting court interference (e.g., Bharat Aluminium Co. v. Kaiser Aluminium, 2012). It’s cost-effective and confidential, but challenges include arbitrator bias, addressed by the 2019 Act’s independence criteria, making it vital for trade disputes."""
"""What is the difference between a decree and an order?""","""Under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), a decree and an order differ in scope and finality. A decree (Section 2(2)) is the formal expression of an adjudication conclusively determining the rights of parties in a suit, issued by a court, covering final, preliminary, or partly preliminary decisions (e.g., divorce decree). An order (Section 2(14)) is a direction of a court not amounting to a decree, addressing procedural or interim matters (e.g., injunctions, payment directions). Decrees are appealable under Section 96, while most orders are not unless specified (e.g., Section 104). Cases like Madan Naik v. Hansubala Devi (1983) highlight their distinction, impacting legal remedies."""
"""What is the Evidence Act?""","""The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, regulates the admissibility, relevance, and presentation of evidence in Indian courts. It applies to civil and criminal proceedings, defining facts (Section 3), oral and documentary evidence (Sections 59-60), and presumptions (e.g., Section 114). Key provisions include the exclusion of hearsay (Section 60), privilege (e.g., lawyer-client, Section 126), and expert testimony (Section 45). Amendments, like the 2002 change allowing video evidence, modernized it. Landmark cases like R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra (1973) upheld taped conversations’ admissibility if authentic. It ensures fair trials, balancing proof with justice, though digital evidence challenges persist."""
"""What is the difference between a plaint and a written statement?""","""In the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, a plaint and a written statement are pivotal civil suit documents. A plaint (Order VII) is the plaintiff’s initial filing, detailing the cause of action, relief sought (e.g., damages), and parties involved, initiating the suit. A written statement (Order VIII) is the defendant’s response, admitting or denying allegations, raising defenses, and counterclaims if any. The plaint requires a court fee, while the written statement has a 30-day filing limit (extendable). Cases like Umesh Chandra v. Vraj Kishore (1955) stress their mutual dependency—plaint sets the claim, written statement shapes the defense, driving the trial’s course."""
"""What is the Limitation Act?""","""The Limitation Act, 1963, prescribes time limits for filing suits, appeals, or applications in Indian courts to ensure timely justice. It lists periods (e.g., 3 years for contract breaches under Article 55, 12 years for property recovery under Article 65) in its Schedule, starting from the cause of action’s accrual. Section 5 allows condonation of delay with sufficient cause, as seen in Collector, Land Acquisition v. Mst. Katiji (1987). The Act bars remedies after expiry, not rights, promoting legal diligence. Exceptions include fraud (Section 17) or disability (Section 6). It balances justice with finality, impacting civil and criminal proceedings."""
"""What is the difference between a suit and a petition?""","""Under Indian law, a suit and a petition differ in purpose and procedure. A suit, governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is a formal legal action between private parties (e.g., property disputes) seeking remedies like damages or possession, filed in civil courts with a plaint. A petition is a request to a higher court (e.g., Supreme Court under Article 32, High Court under Article 226) for extraordinary relief, like writs (habeas corpus) or constitutional issues, often public-interest driven. Suits follow adversarial trials, while petitions may involve summary proceedings. Cases like A.K. Gopalan (1950) distinguish their jurisdictional scope, shaping legal strategy."""
"""What is the role of a Public Prosecutor?""","""A Public Prosecutor in India, appointed under Section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, represents the state in criminal cases, ensuring justice over mere conviction. They review police reports, file chargesheets, and present evidence in court, acting independently of police. Appointed by the government for Central or State levels, they handle serious offenses (e.g., murder, corruption). The Supreme Court in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh v. State of Gujarat (2004) emphasized their duty to protect witnesses and public interest, not just secure convictions. Their role balances prosecution with fairness, crucial in adversarial systems, though political influence sometimes challenges impartiality."""
"""What is the difference between a gift and a sale?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a gift and a sale differ in consideration and intent. A gift (Section 122) is a voluntary transfer of immovable or movable property without monetary consideration, made out of love or affection, requiring a registered deed for immovable property and acceptance by the donee. A sale (Section 54) is a transfer for a price paid or promised, governed by a contract, with registration mandatory for immovable property above Rs. 100. Gifts are irrevocable once accepted, while sales are contractual, cancellable for breach. Cases like K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vora (2009) clarify their distinct legal effects on title transfer."""
"""What is the Negotiable Instruments Act?""","""The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, regulates promissory notes, bills of exchange, and cheques in India, facilitating commercial transactions. It defines these instruments (Sections 4-6), their negotiation (Section 14), and liabilities (e.g., Section 31 on bankers). Section 138 penalizes cheque dishonor due to insufficient funds with up to two years’ imprisonment and double the cheque amount as compensation, amended in 2018 to expedite trials. Cases like Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharashtra (2014) refined jurisdiction rules. It ensures trust in financial instruments, though digital payment shifts challenge its relevance, prompting judicial adaptations."""
"""What is the difference between a tenant and a licensee?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a tenant and a licensee differ in rights. A tenant, under a lease (Section 105), holds exclusive possession of immovable property for a term, paying rent, with rights to use and sublet (unless restricted), creating a landlord-tenant relationship. A licensee, under a license (Section 52), has mere permission to use property without possession rights, revocable by the licensor (e.g., event access). The Supreme Court in Associated Hotels of India v. R.N. Kapoor (1960) ruled that possession distinguishes them—tenants have legal interest, licensees don’t. This impacts eviction and rent laws."""
"""What is the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act?""","""The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, addresses domestic violence against women in India, including physical, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse by husbands or live-in partners. It provides civil remedies like protection orders (Section 18), residence rights (Section 19), and monetary relief (Section 20), enforceable through magistrates. It covers all women, not just married ones, and establishes Protection Officers. The Act, post the 2005 amendment, was upheld in cases like Sandhya Manoj Wankhade v. Manoj Bhimrao Wankhade (2011) for live-in relationships. Challenges include underreporting and slow enforcement, but it’s a pivotal gender justice tool."""
"""What is the difference between a criminal case and a civil case?""","""In India, a criminal case and a civil case differ in nature and process. A criminal case, prosecuted by the state under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and CrPC, 1973, addresses offenses against society (e.g., murder), aiming for punishment (imprisonment, fines), with the state bearing the burden of proof “beyond reasonable doubt.” A civil case, governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, involves private disputes (e.g., property, divorce), seeking remedies like compensation, with the plaintiff proving on a “preponderance of probabilities” standard. Overlap exists (e.g., dowry deaths), but criminal cases protect public order, while civil cases restore individual rights, as seen in cases like State v. Ram Lal (1960)."""
"""What is the role of the High Court?""","""The High Court in India, established under Article 214 of the Constitution, is the highest judicial authority at the state level, with a Chief Justice and other judges (e.g., 47 in Delhi High Court as of 2024). It has original jurisdiction in constitutional, civil, and criminal matters, appellate jurisdiction over lower courts, and supervisory power under Article 227. It issues writs (Article 226) for Fundamental Rights enforcement, as in D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997) on police custody rights. Each state or union territory has a High Court, with some shared (e.g., Punjab and Haryana), playing a pivotal role in justice delivery and legal interpretation."""
"""What is the difference between a void and voidable contract?""","""Under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a void contract (Section 2(g)) is invalid from the outset, lacking legal enforceability due to illegality (e.g., wagering) or impossibility, with no rights or obligations arising, as in Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903). A voidable contract (Section 2(i)) is valid until rescinded by the aggrieved party, affected by factors like coercion or fraud (e.g., Section 19), allowing the victim to affirm or reject it. Void contracts are null, while voidable ones offer a choice, impacting remedies—void contracts yield no compensation, while voidable ones may. Cases like Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur (1954) clarify their distinction."""
"""What is the Specific Relief Act?""","""The Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides remedies in India for enforcing civil rights when damages are inadequate. It allows specific performance of contracts (e.g., property sales, Section 10), injunctions (Section 36-42) to prevent harm, and recovery of possession (Section 5-8). Governed by equity principles, it applies when monetary compensation isn’t sufficient, as in K.S. Vidyanadam v. Vairavan (1997). Amendments in 2018 expedited proceedings, barring suits against government contracts (Section 20A). It balances contractual obligations with judicial discretion, crucial for property and trust disputes, though delays in execution remain a challenge."""
"""What is the difference between a power of attorney and a will?""","""In Indian law, a power of attorney (POA) and a will differ in purpose and effect. A POA, under the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882, is a legal authorization allowing one person (agent) to act for another (principal) during the principal’s lifetime, revocable, covering acts like property sales. A will, under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, is a testamentary document disposing of property after the testator’s death, taking effect posthumously, requiring two witnesses. A POA is operative immediately or as specified, while a will is dormant until death. Cases like Manak Chand v. Ram Chandra (1980) distinguish their scope, impacting agency and succession."""
"""What is the role of the Election Commission?""","""The Election Commission of India (ECI), established under Article 324 of the Constitution, is an autonomous body overseeing elections to Parliament, state legislatures, and the President/Vice-President. Comprising a Chief Election Commissioner and two Commissioners (as of 2025), it ensures free and fair elections, registering parties, monitoring campaign finances, and enforcing the Model Code of Conduct. It delineates constituencies and updates electoral rolls, as seen in its 2024 delimitation efforts. Cases like T.N. Seshan v. Union of India (1995) affirmed its independence. Its powers, though vast, face challenges from political pressures, making it a democratic cornerstone."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu Undivided Family and a joint family?""","""In Indian law, a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) and a joint family are related but distinct. An HUF, recognized under the Income Tax Act, 1961, is a legal entity of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, or Buddhists sharing a common ancestor, coparceners (males and, post-2005 amendment, females) holding ancestral property with coparcenary rights, taxed separately. A joint family is a broader social unit, including all members (coparceners and non-coparceners) living together with shared customs, not necessarily a legal entity. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, in cases like Prakash v. Phulavati (2016), equalized daughters’ rights, aligning HUF with joint family evolution."""
"""What is the Information Technology Act?""","""The Information Technology Act, 2000, amended in 2008, governs electronic transactions, cybercrime, and data protection in India. It recognizes digital signatures (Section 3), facilitates e-governance, and penalizes offenses like hacking (Section 66), data theft, and online fraud (Section 66A, struck down in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, 2015). It establishes the Cyber Appellate Tribunal (now defunct, merged with TDSAT) and empowers the government to block content. The 2008 amendment added Section 69 for surveillance and Section 79 for intermediary liability. It aligns with global cyber norms, though enforcement lags due to technical and jurisdictional issues."""
"""What is the difference between a mortgage and a pledge?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a mortgage and a pledge differ in asset type and rights. A mortgage (Section 58) involves transferring an interest in immovable property (e.g., land) as security for a loan, with the mortgagor retaining possession unless agreed otherwise, redeemable under Section 60. A pledge (Section 172, Indian Contract Act, 1872) is a bailment of movable property (e.g., gold) to a creditor, who gains possession but not ownership, with the pawner redeeming it. Mortgages require registration, pledges don’t. Cases like K.J. Nathan v. S.V. Maruthi Rao (1964) distinguish their enforceability, impacting recovery processes."""
"""What is the role of the National Human Rights Commission?""","""The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is an autonomous body in India to protect and promote human rights. Headed by a retired Chief Justice of India and members with judicial or human rights expertise, it investigates violations (e.g., custodial deaths, discrimination) under Article 21, recommends remedies, and advises the government. It lacks enforcement power, relying on moral suasion, as seen in its 2023 report on manual scavenging. Cases like NHRC v. State of Arunachal Pradesh (1996) highlight its role in tribal rights. Its effectiveness is limited by resource constraints and state compliance issues."""
"""What is the difference between a trust and a society?""","""In India, a trust and a society differ in legal structure and purpose. A trust, under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, is a relationship where property is held by a trustee for beneficiaries, created for private (e.g., family) or public (e.g., charity) purposes, requiring a trust deed. A society, under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, is an association of persons (minimum seven) for promoting art, science, or charity, registered with a memorandum of association, functioning democratically. Trusts are managed by trustees, societies by governing bodies. Cases like CIT v. Trustees of H.E.H. The Nizam’s Wedding Gifts Trusts (1986) clarify their tax implications, impacting nonprofit operations."""
"""What is the Benami Transactions Act?""","""The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, amended in 2016 as the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, prevents benami transactions—property held by one person for another’s benefit to evade taxes or law. It declares such transactions void (Section 3), with penalties including confiscation (Section 5) and up to seven years’ imprisonment (Section 53). The 2016 amendment strengthened enforcement via the Benami Prohibition Authority. Cases like Ganpati Dealcom Pvt. Ltd. v. UOI (2017) upheld its retrospective application, targeting black money. Challenges include defining benami intent and procedural delays, making it a key anti-corruption tool."""
"""What is the difference between a summons and a warrant?""","""Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, a summons and a warrant differ in purpose and issuance. A summons (Section 61) is a court order requiring a person’s appearance to answer a non-serious offense or as a witness, served by police or post, non-custodial. A warrant (Section 70) is a judicial authorization for arrest, issued for serious offenses or non-compliance, executable by police with custody. Summons are bailable, warrants may be bailable or non-bailable. The Supreme Court in Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal (2007) stressed warrants’ necessity, ensuring due process while balancing enforcement needs."""
"""What is the role of the Central Vigilance Commission?""","""The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), established in 1964 and statutorily under the CVC Act, 2003, is an anti-corruption watchdog in India, overseeing central government employees and public sector undertakings. Headed by a Central Vigilance Commissioner, it advises on corruption prevention, investigates complaints, and supervises the CBI in anti-corruption cases (excluding sanction). It promotes transparency via vigilance awareness weeks. Cases like Vineet Narain v. Union of India (1998) enhanced its autonomy. Its advisory role limits enforcement, relying on government action, facing challenges from political interference and resource constraints."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu and Muslim personal law?""","""In India, Hindu and Muslim personal laws differ due to religious foundations. Hindu law, under acts like the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and Hindu Succession Act, 1956, governs marriage, succession, and adoption for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists, codifying customs with state intervention (e.g., monogamy, equal inheritance). Muslim personal law, based on uncodified Sharia and the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, applies to Muslims, allowing polygamy (up to four wives), talaq (divorce), and inheritance favoring males (e.g., 2:1 ratio), with limited statutory reform (e.g., Shah Bano case, 1985). The Supreme Court in Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017) struck triple talaq, signaling reform, highlighting their divergent evolution."""
"""What is the Indian Succession Act?""","""The Indian Succession Act, 1925, consolidates succession and inheritance laws for Christians, Parsis, and others (excluding Muslims and Hindus, who follow personal laws). It governs testamentary succession (wills, Sections 57-191) and intestate succession (no will, Sections 32-56), ensuring equitable property distribution. For Christians, it mandates equal shares among heirs; for Parsis, it includes spousal rights. Wills require two witnesses and sound mind, with probate for immovable property. Cases like Anil Kak v. Kumari Shobha (2007) clarified its application. It harmonizes diverse practices, though gaps remain for uncodified communities."""
"""What is the difference between a plaint and a complaint?""","""Under Indian law, a plaint and a complaint differ in context. A plaint, under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Order VII), is a formal document initiating a civil suit, detailing the plaintiff’s claim (e.g., property dispute) and relief sought, filed in a civil court. A complaint, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Section 2(d)), is an allegation of a cognizable or non-cognizable offense made to a magistrate or police, prompting investigation or trial (e.g., theft). Plaints seek remedies, complaints trigger prosecution. Cases like Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre (1988) distinguish their procedural roles."""
"""What is the role of the Lokpal?""","""The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, established the Lokpal as an anti-corruption ombudsman in India, probing complaints against public servants, including the Prime Minister (with safeguards). Headed by a Chairperson and up to eight members, it has jurisdiction over central government officials, with state Lokayuktas mirroring it. It can order investigations, recommend action, and confiscate assets, as seen in its 2023 probe into MPs. The Supreme Court in Common Cause v. Union of India (2017) pushed its activation. Its effectiveness is hampered by delays in appointments and limited powers, aiming to enhance transparency."""
"""What is the difference between a leasehold and freehold property?""","""In India, under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, leasehold and freehold properties differ in ownership. Freehold property grants absolute ownership to the buyer, with perpetual rights to use, sell, or bequeath (e.g., outright land purchase), requiring no renewal. Leasehold property involves a lease agreement (Section 105) for a fixed term (e.g., 99 years), where the lessee holds rights subject to the lessor’s title, with rent and reversion to the owner post-term. Cases like T.V. Ibrahim v. Regional Transport Authority (1953) clarify leasehold’s temporary nature. This impacts taxation and transferability, with freehold offering more security."""
"""What is the Protection of Civil Rights Act?""","""The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, combats untouchability and discrimination in India, enforcing Article 17 of the Constitution. It penalizes acts like denying access to public places (Section 4) or enforcing disabilities (Section 3) with imprisonment up to six months or fines, amended in 1976 to strengthen enforcement. It covers Scheduled Castes and Tribes, with state governments tasked to promote awareness. Cases like State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale (1993) upheld its punitive scope. Challenges include social resistance and poor implementation, making it a key equality tool."""
"""What is the difference between a criminal appeal and a civil appeal?""","""In India, a criminal appeal and a civil appeal differ in basis and process. A criminal appeal, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (e.g., Section 374), challenges a conviction or acquittal in criminal cases (e.g., murder), filed by the accused or state in higher courts (High Court, Supreme Court), focusing on legal errors or evidence. A civil appeal, under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Section 96), contests civil judgments (e.g., property disputes), initiated by aggrieved parties, seeking remedy review. Criminal appeals prioritize justice, civil appeals focus on rights, as seen in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (1992)."""
"""What is the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General?""","""The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, under Article 148 of the Constitution, is the guardian of public finance, auditing central and state government accounts. Appointed by the President, the CAG ensures expenditure aligns with appropriations, submitting reports to Parliament/State Legislatures (e.g., 2G spectrum case, 2012). It has no executive role but influences policy via audit findings. Cases like Common Cause v. Union of India (1999) reinforced its independence. Challenges include delayed audits and limited follow-up, making it vital for fiscal accountability."""
"""What is the difference between a co-owner and a joint owner?""","""Under Indian law, a co-owner and a joint owner differ in property rights. A co-owner holds a distinct share in property (e.g., under a partition), with individual rights to sell or bequeath, governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. A joint owner, in a joint tenancy or Hindu Undivided Family, holds an undivided interest with others, with rights of survivorship (property passes to surviving owners), as in coparcenary property. The Hindu Succession Act, 2005, in Prakash v. Phulavati (2016), equalized daughters’ joint ownership. This impacts succession and division, with co-ownership allowing severance, joint ownership requiring unity."""
"""What is the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act?""","""The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, protects SCs and STs from caste-based atrocities in India. It penalizes acts like land grabbing (Section 3(1)(v)) or humiliation (Section 3(1)(x)) with imprisonment from six months to life. Amended in 2015, it added provisions for public servants’ complicity and enhanced penalties. Exclusive courts handle cases, with the Supreme Court in Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra (2018) refining arrest guidelines to curb misuse. Challenges include low conviction rates and social biases, making it a critical social justice law."""
"""What is the difference between a patent and a trademark?""","""In India, a patent and a trademark, under the Patents Act, 1970, and Trademarks Act, 1999, differ in protection. A patent grants exclusive rights for 20 years to an inventor for a new, non-obvious invention (e.g., a device), requiring a detailed application and examination by the Patent Office. A trademark protects a brand’s symbol, name, or logo (e.g., logos) indefinitely with renewal, registered to prevent confusion. Patents cover functional innovation, trademarks identity, as clarified in Bayer Corp. v. Union of India (2010), impacting commercial and legal strategies."""
"""What is the role of the National Green Tribunal?""","""The National Green Tribunal (NGT), established under the NGT Act, 2010, adjudicates environmental disputes in India. With benches in Delhi, Bhopal, Pune, Kolkata, and Chennai, it comprises judicial and expert members, addressing violations of laws like the Water Act, 1974. It offers speedy justice (within 6 months) and penalties, as in Sterlite Industries v. TNPCB (2013) on pollution. Its suo motu powers and appeal to the Supreme Court enhance enforcement. Challenges include limited jurisdiction and funding, making it vital for ecological balance."""
"""What is the difference between a decree holder and a judgment debtor?""","""Under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, a decree holder and a judgment debtor are parties in a civil suit. A decree holder is the successful litigant entitled to enforce a court decree (e.g., for money or property) under Section 2(3), holding execution rights. A judgment debtor is the losing party obligated to comply with the decree (e.g., pay damages) under Section 2(10). The decree holder initiates execution (e.g., attachment), while the debtor faces consequences like arrest if non-compliant, as in Shyam Sundar v. Sankari Prasad (1962)."""
"""What is the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act?""","""The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, addresses workplace sexual harassment in India, post-Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997) guidelines. It mandates Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with over 10 employees and Local Committees for others, handling complaints with penalties (fines or jail up to 3 years, Section 13-14). It covers all workplaces, public or private, ensuring a safe environment. Cases like Medha Kotwal Lele v. Union of India (2013) reinforced its implementation, though awareness and reporting gaps persist."""
"""What is the difference between a negotiable instrument and a non-negotiable instrument?""","""Under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, a negotiable instrument (e.g., cheque, promissory note) is transferable by delivery or endorsement, conferring title to the holder (Section 13), used in commerce with legal recognition. A non-negotiable instrument (e.g., fixed deposit receipt) cannot be transferred, lacking negotiability, serving as a personal contract. The Supreme Court in Kundan Lal v. Custodian, Evacuee Property (1961) upheld this, impacting financial transactions’ fluidity versus security."""
"""What is the role of the Central Information Commission?""","""The Central Information Commission (CIC), under the Right to Information Act, 2005, is the final appellate authority for RTI disputes in India. Headed by a Chief Information Commissioner and up to 10 Commissioners, it reviews PIO denials, imposes penalties (Rs. 25,000 max, Section 20), and ensures transparency. It handles 20,000+ cases annually, as seen in its 2023 backlog reports. Cases like CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011) strengthened its role. Challenges include delays and limited enforcement power, making it key for accountability."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu joint family and a partnership?""","""In India, a Hindu joint family, under Hindu law, is a customary unit of coparceners (e.g., HUF) sharing ancestral property with survivorship rights, governed by birth, not contract. A partnership, under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, is a voluntary association of individuals (minimum two) for profit, based on a partnership deed, with mutual agency and liability. The Hindu Succession Act, 2005, altered joint family dynamics, while partnerships dissolve on death unless agreed, as in Cox v. Hickman (1860), impacting succession and business."""
"""What is the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act?""","""The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, ensures maintenance for parents and senior citizens (above 60) by children or relatives in India. It allows tribunals to order monthly support (up to Rs. 10,000, Section 4) and protect property rights, with penalties for neglect (Section 24). State governments implement it, with helplines. Cases like Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India (2005) highlight its welfare intent. Challenges include enforcement and cultural resistance, aiming to secure elderly dignity."""
"""What is the difference between a public company and a private company?""","""Under the Companies Act, 2013, a public company (Section 2(71)) has minimum 7 members, no cap, with shares tradable on stock exchanges, requiring SEBI compliance and public disclosure. A private company (Section 2(68)) restricts membership to 200, prohibits public invites, and limits share transfers, offering privacy. Public companies face stricter audits, as in Satyam Computer Services (2009), while private ones enjoy flexibility, impacting capital and governance."""
"""What is the role of the National Commission for Women?""","""The National Commission for Women (NCW), established under the NCW Act, 1990, safeguards women’s rights in India. With a Chairperson and members, it investigates atrocities, reviews laws, and recommends policy, addressing issues like dowry or harassment. It handled 20,000+ complaints in 2023. Cases like Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997) influenced its mandate. Its advisory role limits enforcement, facing funding and awareness gaps, making it a gender justice advocate."""
"""What is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code?""","""The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), streamlines insolvency resolution in India for individuals and companies. It establishes the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), and processes for corporate (Chapter II) and personal (Chapter III) insolvency, aiming for time-bound resolution (180-270 days). It prioritizes creditors, as in Swiss Ribbons v. Union of India (2019). Challenges include delays and asset value loss, making it a reformative economic tool."""
"""What is the difference between a landlord and a tenant?""","""Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a landlord (lessor) owns immovable property and grants a lease (Section 105) to a tenant (lessee) for rent, retaining reversionary rights. A tenant holds possession for the lease term, with use rights but not ownership, liable for rent. The Rent Control Acts vary by state, as in Ahmedabad v. Haji Abdul (1980), impacting eviction and rent fixation, shaping their legal relationship."""
"""What is the role of the Union Public Service Commission?""","""The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), under Article 315 of the Constitution, conducts civil service exams (e.g., IAS, IPS) and advises on appointments, promotions, and disciplinary actions for central services. With a Chairman and members, it ensures merit-based recruitment, as in its 2024 CSE. Cases like Jaisinghani v. Union of India (1967) upheld its fairness. Its advisory role limits enforcement, facing political influence challenges, key for governance."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu coparcener and a member?""","""In Hindu law, a coparcener, under the Hindu Succession Act, 2005, is a person (male or female since amendment) by birth in a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) with a right to ancestral property and partition, limited to four generations. A member is any family member (e.g., wife, daughter-in-law) without such rights, sharing maintenance or residence benefits. Prakash v. Phulavati (2016) equalized coparcenary, distinguishing their property roles."""
"""What is the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act?""","""The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, grants land rights to forest-dwelling communities in India. It recognizes individual and community rights (e.g., 4 hectares per family, Section 3), protecting against eviction. Implemented by gram sabhas, it countered colonial forest laws. Cases like Niyamgiri (2013) upheld tribal consent, but delays and encroachments challenge its efficacy."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu widow’s estate and a full estate?""","""Under Hindu law, a Hindu widow’s estate, pre-Hindu Succession Act, 1956, allowed a widow limited rights to her husband’s property for maintenance, not full ownership, with reversion to heirs post-death. A full estate, post-1956, grants absolute ownership to female heirs. The Act, in G. Sekar v. Geetha (2009), abolished the limited estate, ensuring equal inheritance, impacting succession rights."""
"""What is the role of the State Human Rights Commission?""","""The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC), under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, mirrors the NHRC at state levels, investigating human rights violations by state actors. With a Chairperson and members, it recommends remedies and awareness, handling 5,000+ cases annually (e.g., 2023 Tamil Nadu report). Cases like PUDR v. State of Bihar (1987) influenced its scope. Limited by funding and state cooperation, it’s vital for local justice."""
"""What is the difference between a promissory note and a bill of exchange?""","""Under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, a promissory note (Section 4) is a written promise by a maker to pay a fixed sum to a payee, signed (e.g., loan repayment), with two parties. A bill of exchange (Section 5) is an order by a drawer to a drawee to pay a payee, involving three parties (e.g., trade draft). Cases like Kundan Lal v. Custodian (1961) distinguish their negotiability, affecting commercial use."""
"""What is the Maintenance of Internal Security Act?""","""The Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 1971, was an emergency law in India to detain individuals threatening national security, repealed in 1977 post-Emergency. It allowed preventive detention without trial, used during 1975-1977, affecting 1,00,000+ people. The Supreme Court in A.D.M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976) controversially upheld it, later criticized. It’s a historical example of balancing security and liberty, replaced by the National Security Act, 1980."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu adoption and a guardianship?""","""Under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, adoption creates a permanent legal parent-child relationship, transferring all rights (e.g., inheritance) to the adoptee, requiring consent and registration. Guardianship, under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, is a temporary care arrangement (e.g., for minors), without inheritance rights, revocable. Cases like Gaurav Nagpal v. Sumedha Nagpal (2009) clarify adoption’s finality versus guardianship’s custody focus."""
"""What is the role of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes?""","""The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), under Article 338, monitors SC welfare in India. With a Chairperson and members, it investigates atrocities, reviews laws, and advises the President, handling 15,000+ cases in 2023. Cases like State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale (1993) shaped its mandate. Limited enforcement power and state delays challenge its effectiveness, making it a key equity body."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu marriage and a Muslim marriage?""","""A Hindu marriage, under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, is a sacrament requiring ceremonies (e.g., saptapadi), monogamous, with judicial divorce (Section 13). A Muslim marriage (nikah), under Muslim Personal Law, is a contract, potentially polygamous (up to four wives), with talaq or mutual consent for dissolution. The Supreme Court in Shayara Bano v. Union of India (2017) banned instant triple talaq, highlighting their divergent legal and cultural bases."""
"""What is the Indian Stamp Act?""","""The Indian Stamp Act, 1899, regulates stamp duty on legal documents (e.g., sale deeds, mortgages) in India, ensuring revenue and validity. Duty varies by state (e.g., 5-7% of property value), payable on execution, with penalties for evasion (Section 40). The Supreme Court in Hindustan Steel Ltd. v. State of Orissa (1970) allowed discretion in penalties. Digital stamping and interstate disparities challenge its uniformity, vital for legal recognition."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu coparcenary and a partnership firm?""","""A Hindu coparcenary, under Hindu law, is a birth-based unit of HUF members (up to four generations) with ancestral property rights, governed by survivorship (pre-2005). A partnership firm, under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, is a contractual association for profit, with mutual liability, dissolvable by agreement. The Hindu Succession Act, 2005, in Prakash v. Phulavati (2016), altered coparcenary, unlike partnership’s voluntary nature."""
"""What is the role of the National Commission for Minorities?""","""The National Commission for Minorities (NCM), under the NCM Act, 1992, protects the rights of notified minorities (Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, etc.) in India. With a Chairperson and members, it investigates grievances, reviews policies, and recommends welfare measures, handling 10,000+ cases in 2023. Cases like T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) influenced its educational focus. Limited powers and funding gaps hinder its impact."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu will and a Muslim will?""","""A Hindu will, under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, is a testamentary disposition of property, requiring two witnesses, effective post-death, with no restriction on property share. A Muslim will, under Muslim Personal Law, allows bequest of one-third of property without heirs’ consent, with the rest governed by inheritance rules, unwitnessed but oral in some cases. Cases like Umar Hayat Khan v. Amir Bano (1924) clarify their distinct frameworks."""
"""What is the Foreign Exchange Management Act?""","""The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), regulates foreign exchange transactions in India, replacing FERA, 1973, with a civil approach. It governs capital account transactions, foreign investment, and penalties (e.g., Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2 lakh, Section 13) by the RBI and ED. Cases like Maniklal v. Premchand (1970) shaped its compliance focus. It balances economic liberalization with control, facing challenges from global finance complexities."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu succession and a Muslim succession?""","""Hindu succession, under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (amended 2005), provides equal inheritance to males and females in ancestral and self-acquired property, with Class I heirs (e.g., sons, daughters) prioritized. Muslim succession, under Muslim Personal Law, follows Sharia, with fixed shares (e.g., 2:1 male-female ratio), excluding adoption, and no testamentary freedom beyond one-third. Cases like Gulam Abbas v. Haji Kayyum Ali (1973) highlight their divergent principles."""
"""What is the role of the Central Administrative Tribunal?""","""The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, adjudicates service disputes of central government employees in India. With benches across cities, it offers speedy justice (within 3 years), covering recruitment and discipline. Cases like L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) affirmed its judicial status. Limited jurisdiction and backlog challenge its efficiency, making it key for administrative justice."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu adoption and a Christian adoption?""","""A Hindu adoption, under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, is a permanent legal parent-child bond with inheritance, requiring consent. A Christian adoption, absent a uniform law, follows the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, as a temporary guardianship, without automatic inheritance, needing court approval. Cases like John Vallamattom v. Union of India (2003) pushed for Christian adoption reform, highlighting their legal disparity."""
"""What is the National Food Security Act?""","""The National Food Security Act, 2013, ensures food and nutritional security in India, providing subsidized food grains (5 kg per person monthly) to 67% of the population via the Public Distribution System. It prioritizes pregnant women, children, and destitute, with grievance redressal mechanisms. Cases like PUCL v. Union of India (2011) influenced its right-to-food basis. Implementation gaps and leakages challenge its reach, making it a welfare cornerstone."""
"""What is the difference between a Hindu gift and a Muslim gift?""","""A Hindu gift, under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (Section 122), is a voluntary property transfer without consideration, requiring registration for immovable property and acceptance.
